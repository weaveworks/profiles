## Getting started

### Dependencies

The dependency [libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) v1.1.0 needs to be installed to be able to run
the Controller or its test-suite locally. [Docs on install libgit2](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-required-dependencies)

[buf](https://buf.build) is needed to generate and lint protoc code. For more details check out [Generating the protocol files](#generating-the-protocol-files).

### Local environment using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

1. Set up local environment: `make local-env`.

    This will start a local `kind` cluster and installs
    the `profiles` and `flux` components.

1. Deploy an example catalog source `kubectl apply -f examples/profile-catalog-source.yaml`

### Installing Profiles

1. Profiles can be installed using [pctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl).

## Development

### Tests

1. All tests can be run with `make test`.

1. Acceptance tests can be run with `make acceptance`.

1. For further commands, run `make help`.

### Release process
There are some manual steps right now, should be streamlined soon.

Steps:

1. Create a new release notes file:
	```sh
	touch docs/release_notes/<version>.md
	```

1. Copy-and paste the release notes from the draft on the releases page into this file.
    _Note: sometimes the release drafter is a bit of a pain, verify that the notes are
    correct by doing something like: `git log --first-parent tag1..tag2`._

1. PR the release notes into main.

1. Create and push a tag with the new version:
	```sh
	git tag <version>
	git push origin <version>
	```

1. The `Create release` action should run. Verify that:
	1. The release has been created in Github
		1. With the correct assets
		1. With the correct release notes
	1. The image has been pushed to docker
	1. The image can be pulled and used in a deployment
    
### Dev Tags

As part of pushing a new branch to profiles, a new dev tag will be created for that branch. This action is part of
the procedure around working with profiles and [pctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl), its companion CLI tool. The details of this are
explained in `pctl`'s README section [Working with Profiles](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl#working-with-profiles).

The dev tag's format is as follows: `<currentLatestReleaseTag>-<branch-name>`.

### Generating the protocol files

`profiles` is using [buf](https://buf.build/) to generate and lint protobuf implementations. The protocol descriptor file
can be found here [profiles.proto](./proto/profiles.proto). To update these files, install `buf` and run the make target
`make generate-protoc`. Profiles, using the [tools](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module) way to track dependencies,
and should already have all the necessary protoc tools installed.

When running `buf` for the first time, install all the necessary libraries by running `buf beta mod update`. This will install
dependencies defined in [buf.yaml](./buf.yaml) file.

What gets generated is defined by [buf.gen.yaml](./buf.gen.yaml) file. For the document target to work, install `protoc-gen-doc`
by running `go get -u github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc`.

Documentation about the protoc files can be found under [docs/index.html](./docs/index.html).

## Terminology

### Profile

A Profile is a "package" of Kubernetes deployable objects, known as Artifacts, and configurable values.
Artifacts are one of: Helm Chart; Helm Release; raw yaml; Kustomize patch; Profile (nested).

For an example, see the [profiles-examples](https://github.com/weaveworks/profiles-examples).

### Catalog

A Catalog is an in-memory cache of Profiles. There is one Catalog per running [Profile Controller](#profile-controller).
The Catalog is queryable via [pctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl) or the API directly which runs alongside the Profiles Controller.

Profiles can be added to the Catalog by creating a [`ProfileCatalogSource`](#profile-catalog-source).

### Profile Catalog Source

A `ProfileCatalogSource` is a custom resource through which approved Profiles can be managed in the [Catalog](#catalog)

```go
// ProfileCatalogSourceSpec defines the desired state of ProfileCatalogSource
type ProfileCatalogSourceSpec struct {
	// Profiles is the list of profiles exposed by the catalog
	Profiles []ProfileDescription `json:"profiles,omitempty"`
}

// ProfileDescription defines details about a given profile.
type ProfileDescription struct {
	// Profile name
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Profile description
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// Version
	// +optional
	Version string `json:"version,omitempty"`
	// CatalogSource is the name of the catalog the profile is listed in
	// +optional
	CatalogSource string `json:"catalog,omitempty"`
	// URL is the full URL path to the profile.yaml
	// +optional
	URL string `json:"url,omitempty"`
	// Maintainer is the name of the author(s)
	// +optional
	Maintainer string `json:"maintainer,omitempty"`
	// Prerequisites are a list of dependencies required by the profile
	// +optional
	Prerequisites []string `json:"prerequisites,omitempty"`
}
```

Profiles can therefore be grouped and namespaced within the Catalog.


### Profile Catalog Source Controller

The Profile Catalog Source Controller reconciles `ProfileCatalogSource` resources.
See architecture diagrams below for what the reconciliation process does.

### Profile Installation

To see how a profile installation works, take a look at the [pctl documentation](https://github.com/weaveworks/pctl)

## Roadmap

### Profiles

Install:
- [x] Install a simple profile which contains a single Helm release artifact
- [x] Install a simple profile which contains a raw yaml artifact (k8s object manifest)
- [x] Install a simple profile which contains another profile (single nesting)
- [x] Install a profile which contains a mix of all artifact types
- [x] Install a profile which contains nested profiles to depth N
- [x] Install a profile with `pctl` in a gitops way (ie there is a PR involved, and nobody touches the cluster)
- [x] Install a profile which is listed in the catalog
- [x] Install a profile which is NOT listed in the catalog
- [ ] Install a private profile

Configure:
- [x] Configure a Helm release artifact installation
- [ ] Apply Kustomise patches
- [ ] Configure different values across multiple artifacts

Update:
- [ ] Discover when there is a newer version available
- [ ] Update a profile

### Catalogs

Catalog sources:
- [x] Create a catalog source
- [x] Delete a catalog source
- [ ] Grant/Revoke access to CatalogSources

Catalog management:
- [x] Add profiles to the catalog
- [X] Update profiles in the catalog
- [ ] Delete profiles from the catalog

API:
- [x] Search for profiles in the catalog
- [x] Get more information about a profile in the catalog
