# Troubleshooting

The following error is returned on `pctl install`:
```
failed to build artifact: in case of local resources, the flux gitrepository object's details must be provided
```

Refer to the [installer docs](/docs/installer-docs/installing-via-gitops#the-git-repository-flag) for how to use the `--git-repository` flag.
